I initialized the project by running npm init -y to create 'package.json' with default settings

I then installed Webpack and Webpack CLI as developement dependencies by running the following code: npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

The next step was to create a Webpack configuration file 'webpack.config.js' which defines how webpack bundles the assets of the project

Installed Babel and necessary presets as dev dependencies

Wrote describe function in my test file that performs what is expected such as capitalization, reversing of strings etc. 

Created a calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations such as add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of the functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
